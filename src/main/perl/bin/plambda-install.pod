install

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 plambda install
 plambda install lambda
 plambda install runtime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Installs your Lambda function or the custom Perl runtime layer to the
AWS environment.  This command uses the AWS CLI to create or update a
Lambda or to publish a new layer.

 plambda install target

=over 5

=item I<Note:>

In order to install your Lambda AND configure it to use the custom
Perl runtime layer, the layer should have been previously built and
installed. If the framework does not recognize that a build of the
custom Perl runtime layer has been done yet, the framework will
build and install the runtime automatically.

=item I<Note:>

You can force an install by using the C<--force> option.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item * --verbose

=item * --dryrun

=item * --force

Use the C<--force> option to force an install even if the framework
detects that the artifact has already been installed.

B<C<--force> and C<--dryrun> cannot be used together>.  The C<--force>
option will remove the indicators that an operation has been completed
and force a new operation.
