=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reports the current state of your Lambda development. When developing
your Lambda functions you may want to know if your Lambda has been
deployed properly.  I<Properly> can mean that the current code is the
same as that installed to the AWS environment and the function is
configured to use the same CPRL (runtime) you developing against.  The
C<state> command will analyze the current state of your Lambda and
build tree. The command will:

=over 5

=item * ...determine if your Lambda module specified in the buildspec exists

=item * ...determine if your Lambda module has been built and is up-to-date

=item * ...determine if the Lambda package has been deployed to the AWS environment

=item * ...determine if the Lambda package is identical to the one deployed to the AWS environment

=item * ...reports the current state of the runtime layer

=back

Columns will be color coded to suggest the current state and
potential actions you might want to take.

=item * green => current

=item * yellow => needs to be installed

=item * --- => not installed

=item CPRL

=over 10

=item * green => function specifies a valid installed runtime

=item * red => function is out of sync with working runtime

=item * yellow => function specifies a valid runtime but there is no working runtime in your build tree
