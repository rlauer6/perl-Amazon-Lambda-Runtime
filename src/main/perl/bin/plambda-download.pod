download

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 plambda download runtime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Downloads the most recent or a specified version of the custom Perl
runtime layer (CPRL).  You download the CPRL to inject the runtime
into your build tree so that the system can package your Lambda in the
context of that particular version of the CPRL.

By downloading a runtime into your build tree, you'll be able to
produce the smallest Lambda packages necessary in order to run your
handler.

Your Lambda must have a runtime to build against, therefore if you do
not download a runtime, one will be built and installed for you.

After running the C<download> command you'll have these artifacts in
your build tree:

=over 5

=item * runtime-cpanfile.yml

=item * runtime-cpanspec

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item * --version

Specify the version of the runtime to download.
