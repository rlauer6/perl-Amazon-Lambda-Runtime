=head1 SYNOPSIS

 plambda --force deploy runtime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Builds I<AND> installs a custom Perl runtime layer or Lambda package.
Typically, if you want to re-deploy a runtime or Lambda you can force
a build and then run the C<install> command. The C<deploy> command is
a one stop shop.

 plambda --force build runtime
 plambda install runtime

or

 plambda --force deploy runtime

The C<deploy> command can also be used to automatically configure the
project if a change is detected in your buildspec file. So, instead of doing:

 plambda config && plambda install lambda

...do

 plambda deploy lambda

You'll need to re-build and re-install your Lambda package whenever
you build a new runtime, assuming if you want the Lambda to use the
new runtime. You can do this by running the C<install> command
after deploying a new runtime.

 plambda deploy runtime
 plambda install lambda

I<plambda> will automatically recognize that there is a new runtime
version and re-build the Lambda when you run the C<install> command.
