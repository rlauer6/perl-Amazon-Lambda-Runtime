=head1 NAME

build

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 plambda build runtime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Builds the runtime or Lambda zip file. After a successful run, the zip
files can be found in F<$PLAMBDA_HOME/.plambda> directory.  The
runtime zip file will be named F<perl-runtime.zip>.  The Lambda
zipfile will be the named based on your Lambda name (name of the Perl
module containing your handler).

The C<build> command requires that you have created a F<buildspec.yml>
file and successfully executing the C<config> command.

Whenver you update your F<buildspec.yml> file, you'll need to rebuild
and install your Lambda.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item * --dryrun

Reports what operations would be performed, but does not perform
them. Do not use C<--force> and C<--dryrun> together for obvious
reasons.

=item * --force

Forces a build of the runtime or Lambda package.

=item * --no-scandeps

Normally, if you modify your Lambda or use the C<--force> option,
I<plambda> will re-run F<scandeps.pl> to freshen your F<cpanfile>.
This may not be what you want if you have been manually maintaining
that file. This is especially true if you encounter one or more
errors when C<cpanm> attempts to install certain modules.  In that
case, use the C<--no-scandeps> option to prevent clobbering your
F<cpanfile>.
