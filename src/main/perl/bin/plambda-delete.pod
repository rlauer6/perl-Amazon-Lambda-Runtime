=head1 SYNOPIS

 plambda delete layer
 plambda delete lambda

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Delete custom Perl runtime layers or Lambda functions from the AWS
environment.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 5

=item * function | lambda

Removes the latest function (and all vesions) or a specific version of
a function if the C<--version> option is provided.

=item * runtime

Deletes custom Perl runtime layers from the AWS environment.  If
you've been installing custom Perl runtimes, you may be accumulating them
unnecessarily. This is a convenience command that executes the
C<delete-layer-version> CLI command.  You can delete the I<latest
version (default)>, I<a specific version>, or I<all of the
older versions while keeping the latest version>.

=item * --old

Delete only the older versions, do not delete the latest version. Note
that unlike Lambdas, layers do not have the concept of the $LATEST
version. You can only I<publish> layer versions and each layer is given a
monotonically incrementing value.

When a Lambda is installed, it is configured to use a I<specfic
version> of the custom Perl runtime layer.

=item * --dryrun

Report what will be deleted, but do not delete anything.

=item * --version

Specify the version to delete.  The default is to delete the latest
version.  Should be an integer.  Note that by default, when you
install a Lambda it is B<not> given a version number.  In order to
version your Lambdas you must publish a version.

 aws lambda publish-version --function-name --revision-id
